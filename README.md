Good day! Here is a single page website called 'Rock Wool Shears' which is my take on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. During the development of this project, I had been following The Odin Project and recreating the game was one of the assignments given. I made this to mainly get familiar with manipulating the DOM and learn how to use JavaScript in general.
